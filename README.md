# BEAT

## Download and Install the Beat.apk to run in your phone

I developed this application as part of my summer training in CDAC Mohali.
This is a simple music player application developed in Android Studio in JAVA.
It uses the shared content data of your android phones and plays the mp3 file chose by the user.
It has an option to record the audio and the audio will get stored in the database.
It also has a webview tab being used to search lyrics for any song on Google.
It even displays the playlist created within the android phone.
